# sillycase
Solution to the code challenges Sillycase:

I need you to create a new function for me. This one will be named sillycase and it'll take a single string as an argument.
sillycase should return the same string but the first half should be lowercased and the second half should be uppercased.
For example, with the string "Treehouse", sillycase would return "treeHOUSE".
